AudioMuse-AI is an Open Source Dockerized environment that brings **automatic playlist generation** to your self-hosted music library. Using powerful tools like [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), it performs **sonic analysis** on your audio files locally, allowing you to curate the perfect playlist for any mood or occasion without relying on external APIs. 

Deploy it easily on your local machine with Docker Compose/Podman or scale it up in your Kubernetes cluster, with the support of **AMD64** and **ARM64** architecture. It integrate with API the main Music server like [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), [LMS](https://github.com/epoupon/lms/tree/master), [Lyrion](https://lyrion.org/) and many mores will come in the future.

AudioMuse-AI offers several unique ways to rediscover your music collection:
* **Clustering**: Automatically groups sonically similar songs, creating genre-defying playlists based on the music's actual sound.
* **Playlist from Similar Songs**: Pick a track you love, and AudioMuse-AI will find all the songs in your library that share its sonic signature, creating a new discovery playlist.
* **Song Paths**: Create a seamless listening journey between two or more songs. AudioMuse-AI finds the perfect tracks to bridge the sonic gap.
* **Instant Playlists**: Simply tell the AI what you want to hear—like "high-tempo, low-energy workout music"—and it will instantly generate a playlist for you.
* **Sonic Fingerprint**: Generates playlists based on your listening habits, finding tracks similar to what you've been playing most often.

You can directly check the Helm Chart repo for more details and deployments examples.

## **Quick Start Deployment on K3S**

This section provides a minimal guide to deploy AudioMuse-AI on a K3S (Kubernetes) cluster by direct use of `deployment`

* **Prerequisites:**
    *   A running K3S cluster.
    *   `kubectl` configured to interact with your cluster.
    *   `Jellyfin` or `Navidrome` or `Lyrion` installed.
    *   Respect the HW requirements (look the specific chapter)

*  **Jellyfin Configuration:**
    *   Navigate to the `deployment/` directory.
    *   Edit `deployment.yaml` to configure mandatory parameters:
        *   **Secrets:**
            *   `jellyfin-credentials`: Update `api_token` and `user_id`.
            *   `postgres-credentials`: Update `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB`.
            *   `gemini-api-credentials` (if using Gemini for AI Naming): Update `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
            *   `mistral-api-credentials` (if using Mistral for AI Naming): Update `MISTRAL_API_KEY`.
        *   **ConfigMap (`audiomuse-ai-config`):**
            *   Update `JELLYFIN_URL`.
            *   Ensure `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, and `REDIS_URL` are correct for your setup (defaults are for in-cluster services).

*  **Navidrome/LMS (Open Subsonic API Music Server) Configuration:**
    *   Navigate to the `deployment/` directory.

## **Local Deployment with Docker Compose**

AudioMuse-AI provides Docker Compose files for different media server backends:

- **Jellyfin**: Use `deployment/docker-compose.yaml`
- **Navidrome**: Use `deployment/docker-compose-navidrome.yaml`
- **Lyrion**: Use `deployment/docker-compose-lyrion.yaml`

Choose the appropriate file based on your media server setup.

For a quick local setup or for users not using Kubernetes, a `docker-compose.yaml` file is provided in the `deployment/` directory for interacting with **Jellyfin**. `docker-compose-navidrome.yaml` is instead pre-compiled to interact with **Navidrome** or other Subsonic API based Mediaserver. Finally `docker-compose-lyrion.yaml` is precompiled for Lyrion.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Docker and Docker Compose installed.
*   `Jellyfin` or `Navidrome` or `Lyrion` installed.
*   Respect the [hardware requirements](#hardware-requirements)

**Steps:**
1.  **Navigate to the `deployment` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd deployment
    ```
2.  **Review and Customize:**
    The `docker-compose.yaml`, `docker-compose-navidrome.yaml` and `docker-compose-lyrion.yaml` files are pre-configured with default credentials and settings suitable for local testing. You can edit environment variables within this file directly (e.g., `JELLYFIN_URL`, `JELLYFIN_USER_ID`, `JELLYFIN_TOKEN` for **Jellyfin** or `NAVIDROME_URL`, `NAVIDROME_USER` and `NAVIDROME_PASSWORD` for **Navidrome**,  `LYRION_URL` for Lyrion that doesn't require any passwords).
3.  **Start the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    This command starts all services (Flask app, RQ workers, Redis, PostgreSQL) in detached mode (`-d`).
4.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the containers are up, you can access the web UI at `http://localhost:8000`.
5.  **Stopping the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
**Note:**
  > If you use LMS instead of the password you need to create and use the Subsonic API token. Additional Subsonic API based Mediaserver could require it in place of the password.

## **Local Deployment with Podman Quadlets**

For an alternative local setup, [Podman Quadlet](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html) files are provided in the `deployment/podman-quadlets` directory for interacting with **Navidrome**. The unit files can  be edited for use with **Jellyfin**. 

These files are configured to automatically update AudioMuse-AI using the [latest](#docker-image-tagging-strategy) stable release and should perform an automatic rollback if the updated image fails to start.     

**Prerequisites:**
*   Podman and systemd.
*   `Jellyfin` or `Navidrome` installed.
*   Respect the [hardware requirements](#hardware-requirements)

**Steps:**
1.  **Navigate to the `deployment/podman-quadlets` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd deployment/podman-quadlets
    ```
2.  **Review and Customize:**

    The `audiomuse-ai-postgres.container` and `audiomuse-redis.container` files are pre-configured with default credentials and settings suitable for local testing. <BR>
    You will need to edit environment variables within `audiomuse-ai-worker.container` and `audiomuse-ai-flask.container` files to reflect your personal credentials and environment.
    * For **Navidrome**, update `NAVIDROME_URL`, `NAVIDROME_USER` and `NAVIDROME_PASSWORD` with your real credentials.  
    * For **Jellyfin** replace these variables with `JELLYFIN_URL`, `JELLYFIN_USER_ID`, `JELLYFIN_TOKEN`; add your real credentials; and change the `MEDIASERVER_TYPE` to `jellyfin`. 

    Once you've customized the unit files, you will need to copy all of them into a systemd container directory, such as `/etc/containers/systemd/user/`.<BR>

3.  **Start the Services:**
    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user start audiomuse-pod
    ```
    The first command reloads systemd (generating the systemd service files) and the second command starts all AudioMuse services (Flask app, RQ worker, Redis, PostgreSQL).
4.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the containers are up, you can access the web UI at `http://localhost:8000`.
5.  **Stopping the Services:**
    ```bash
    systemctl --user stop audiomuse-pod
    ```
      
## **Hardware Requirements**

AudioMuse-Ai is actually tested on:
* **INTEL**: HP Mini PC with Intel i5-6500, 16 GB RAM and NVME SSD
* **ARM**: Raspberry Pi 5 8GB RAM and NVME SSD

The **suggested requirements** are: 4core INTEL or ARM CPU (Producted from 2015 and above) with AVX support, 8GB ram and an SSD.

It can most probably run on older CPU (from 3rd gen and above) and with less ram (maybe 4GB) but I never tested.

Intel I7 CPU of first gen or older **DON'T WORK** because Tensorflow require AVX supprt.

If you tested with CPU older than the suggested requirements, please track this in an issue ticket reporting your feedback.

### (Optional) Experimental Nvidia Support

NVidia GPU support is available for the worker process. This can significantly speed up processing of tracks. 

This has been tested with an NVidia RX 3060 running CUDA 12.9 and Driver V575.64.05. During testing, the worker used up to 10GiB of VRAM but your mileage may vary.

**(*)** For using GEMINI API you need to have a Google account, a free account can be used if needed. Same goes for Mistral. Instead if you want to self-host Ollama here you can find a deployment example:

## **Docker Image Tagging Strategy**

Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and pushes Docker images. Here's how our tags work:

* :**latest**  
  * Builds from the **main branch**.  
  * Represents the latest stable release.  
  * **Recommended for most users.**  
* :**devel**  
  * Builds from the **devel branch**.  
  * Contains features still in development, not fully tested, and they could not work.  
  * **Use only for development.**  
* :**vX.Y.Z** (e.g., :v0.1.4-alpha, :v1.0.0)  
  * Immutable tags created from **specific Git releases/tags**.  
  * Ensures you're running a precise, versioned build.  
  * **Use for reproducible deployments or locking to a specific version.**
 
Starting from v0.6.0-beta Librosa library is used for reading song in place of Essentia. We will keep the analysis version with essentia adding the suffix **-esstentia** to the tabg for retrocompatibility.
This **-essentia** version will **not** receive additional implementation or fix on the analysis side BUT it **may** receive the other implementation. This version will be also less tested so avoid it if you don't have any specific reasion to use AudioMuse-AI implementation with essentia.

**IMPORTANT** the `-nvidia` image are **experimantal** image. Try it if you want to help us to improve BUT we suggest to don't use it for normal daily use for now. 

## **Key Technologies**

AudioMuse AI is built upon a robust stack of open-source technologies:

* [**Flask:**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) Provides the lightweight web interface for user interaction and API endpoints.  
* [**Redis Queue (RQ):**](https://redis.io/glossary/redis-queue/) A simple Python library for queueing jobs and processing them in the background with Redis.
* [**Supervisord:**](https://supervisord.org/) Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.
* [**Essentia-tensorflow**](https://essentia.upf.edu/) An open-source library for audio analysis, feature extraction, and music information retrieval. (used only until version v0.5.0-beta)
* [**MusicNN Tensorflow Audio Models from Essentia**](https://essentia.upf.edu/models.html) Leverages pre-trained MusicNN models for feature extraction and prediction. More details and models.
* [**Librosa**](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) Library for audio analysis, feature extraction, and music information retrieval. (used from version v0.6.0-beta)
* [**Tensorflow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Platform developed by Google for building, training, and deploying machine learning and deep learning models.
* [**scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/) Utilized for machine learning algorithms:
* [**voyager**](https://github.com/spotify/voyager) Approximate Nearest Neighbors used for the /similarity interface. Used from v0.6.3-beta
* [**PostgreSQL:**](https://www.postgresql.org/) A powerful, open-source relational database used for persisting:  
* [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) Enables self-hosting of various open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like intelligent playlist naming.
* [**Docker / OCI-compatible Containers**](https://www.docker.com/) – The entire application is packaged as a container, ensuring consistent and portable deployment across environments.
